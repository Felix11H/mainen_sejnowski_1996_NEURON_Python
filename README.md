Python implementation of "Multi-compartment simulations of neocortical neurons".

Original publication: Z. F. Mainen and T. J. Sejnowski (1996) Influence of dendritic structure on firing pattern in model neocortical neurons. Nature 382: 363-366.

Adapted from the implementation found on [ModelDB], all original files including README.txt are included in this repository.

To run first 
```sh
nrnivmodl 
```
then to test everything
```sh
